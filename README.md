 A good project for understanding Keras could be building a neural network for image classification using the famous MNIST dataset. 
 This project will cover data preprocessing, building a neural network model, training the model, and evaluating its performance. 
 Here's a step-by-step guide:
 

This project covers the entire process, from loading data to building, training, and evaluating the model. You can experiment by tweaking hyperparameters, changing the architecture, or trying different datasets to gain a deeper understanding of Keras and neural networks.
